# Request for Proposal (RFP) for Image and Text Block Management System

## Overview
We are seeking proposals for the development of an Image and Text Block Management System. This system will be a web application that stores images and associated text blocks, categorized by a field, with a backend API for CRUD operations. Future iOS and Android apps will interface with the system using the same API.

## Scope of Work
The project will include the following components:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Framework: FastAPI (Python)
   - Database: PostgreSQL on Amazon EC2
   - Object Storage: AWS S3

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Framework: React.js
   - UI Library: Material-UI or Bootstrap

3. **Cloud Services**:
   - AWS EC2 for hosting PostgreSQL
   - AWS S3 for storing images

4. **API Development**:
   - Endpoints for uploading, retrieving, updating, and deleting images and text blocks.
   - Endpoints will be designed to allow independent upload of images and text blocks, tied together by a common ID.

5. **Web Interface**:
   - Image upload with category selection.
   - Text block upload using image ID.
   - Image gallery display by category.
   - Image details view, edit, and delete functionality.
   - User authentication with sign-up and log-in functionality.
   - An operational dashboard for monitoring and managing the system.

6. **Cost Management**:
   - Use cost-effective AWS EC2 instances.
   - Optimize S3 storage costs with lifecycle policies.
   - Utilize cost-effective storage options for RDS PostgreSQL.

7. **Security**:
   - Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Use API key authentication for API access.
   - Ensure proper access controls and data protection.

8. **Deliverables**:
   - Fully functional web application with the specified features.
   - Backend API supporting the described endpoints.
   - Documentation for the API and web application.
   - Deployment scripts and instructions for setting up the environment.
   - An operational dashboard for system monitoring and management.

9. **Timeline and Milestones**:
   - Initial setup and environment configuration.
   - Backend API development.
   - Frontend web application development.
   - Integration and testing.
   - Final deployment and documentation.

## Proposal Requirements
Proposals should include the following:
1. **Technical Approach**:
   - Description of the proposed technical solution.
   - Details on how the system will be implemented and deployed.

2. **Experience and Qualifications**:
   - Relevant experience in similar projects.
   - Team qualifications and individual expertise.

3. **Project Plan**:
   - Detailed project timeline with milestones.
   - Expected deliverables at each milestone.

4. **Cost Proposal**:
   - Hourly rate if responding as an individual.
   - Fixed price if responding as a company or team.
   - Any additional costs or expenses that may be incurred.

5. **Ownership and Intellectual Property**:
   - Confirmation that all software and intellectual property developed as part of this project will be owned by the issuer of this RFP upon final deployment and acceptance.

6. **Operational Dashboard**:
   - Details on the operational dashboard to be provided for system monitoring and management.
